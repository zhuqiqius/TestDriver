Byte

The byte /ˈbaɪt/ is a unit of digital information in computing and telecommunications that most commonly consists of eight bits. 
Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer[1][2] 
and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures. 

The size of the byte has historically been hardware dependent and no definitive standards existed that mandated the size. 
The de facto standard of eight bits is a convenient power of two permitting the values 0 through 255 for one byte.
