Byte

The byte /ˈbaɪt/ is a unit of digital information in computing and telecommunications that most commonly consists of eight bits. 
Historically, the byte was the number of bits used to encode a single character of text in a computer[1][2] 
and for this reason it is the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures. 

The size of the byte has historically been hardware dependent and no definitive standards existed that mandated the size. 
The de facto standard of eight bits is a convenient power of two permitting the values 0 through 255 for one byte.

C# 

long - 64 bits
Int - 32 bits
short - 16 bits

Difference between C# and Java: 

C# and java both were derived from C++, and therefore they have similar roots, both are widely used for web programming. We discuss the difference between C# and java these are as follows: 
•C# has more primitive datatypes
•Java uses static final to declare a class constant while C# uses const.
•Java does not provide for operator overloading.
•C# supports the struct type and java does not.
•Unlike java, all C# datatypes are object.
•C# provides static constructors for initialization.
•In java, parameters are always passed by value, c# allows parameters to be passed by reference by Ref keyword.
•C# includes native support for properties, java does not.
•Java does not directly support enumerations.
•In java, the switch statement can have only integer expression, in C# supports integer and string both.
